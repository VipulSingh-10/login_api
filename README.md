Login API with JWT Authentication

This project is a simple yet robust login API built using Spring Boot and JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. It provides the foundation for implementing a secure authentication mechanism in RESTful APIs, enabling users to log in using their credentials and receive a JWT token for accessing secured endpoints.
